This electric bike is finished!  I know I haven't mentioned it before, but it is a key learning step toward building the electric plane.

#### Back Story

There a lot to talk about with this bike, and I haven't blogged any of it.  In future blogs I'll break it down and focus on lessons learned and interesting details.

#### eBike Features

 * [Sikk Fat Tire Cruise Bike](http://www.sikk.com/mens-ufo.html)
 * 140 cell custom battery pack.  Two 14s5p groups working in parallel to produce 50.4V (nominal) at upto 100A
 * 2x "FlexBMS" Battery Management Systems.
 * [3kW BLDC Hub Motor](http://www.cnqsmotor.com/en/article_read/QS%20Motor%20205%2050H%20V3%20Motor%203000W%20Electric%20High%20Power%20Bike%20Spoke%20Hub%20Motor/259.html)
 * [3-4kW DC Controller/Inverter](https://www.amazon.com/QSMOTOR-SVMC72200-controller-3000W-4000W-Controller/dp/B07DC2987H/ref=sr_1_1)
 * [Raspberry PI 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) as central control of the system
 * [5" touch screen](https://www.amazon.com/GeeekPi-Monitor-Resistive-Interface-Raspberry/dp/B01L6O2NEE/ref=sr_1_3) for user interface
 * Headlights
 * Tail lights with brake lights

#### Performance

##### Top Speed:  

Officially, 20 MPH, because that's the law for electric bikes.  Unofficially, I may have exceeded 40 MPH.
 
##### Range/Endurance:  

I estimate it's more than 50 miles.  The bike was completed this morning and fully charge. Today I rode about 27 miles and the batteries are at about 70% of the top of their voltage range.  Exact watt hours are challenging to calculate.

##### Manual Pedaling:

Undesirable! There have been a few unfortunate test rides where I was miles from home and without electric propulsion.  Basically the bike broke for some reason or another and I had to pedal home.  The bike is heavy!  Maybe 100lbs.  By the time I'd get home, I'd be drenched in sweat.     

#### Versions

The picture above is the most recent version of the eBike, but it is not the first, or second.  Below is a picture of the first version.  It was a primitive configuration with a sad BDLC motor bolted to the frame and driving the rear wheel via an awkward chain. 

Although version 1 was a blast to ride as you can see in the video as my good friend Skim gives it a go, the bike has improved a great deal since then.
