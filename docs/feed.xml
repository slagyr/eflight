&lt;p&gt;They arrived today.  3,000 LG Chem MJ1 cells.  These are 18650 Li-ion cells with a nominal voltage of 3.6 V and a capacity of 3.5 Ah.  That’s 12.6 Wh in each cell. 37.8 kWh in the whole pile of batteries.  Sound like a lot?  Well it’s about the same amount energy as a gallon of gasoline.  A gallon of gas weights about 6 lbs, whereas that pile of batteries weights 330 lbs (150 kg).  And it’s not even enough batteries.  I’ll likely need to get about 2,000 more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eflight/img/2018-09-07/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3000 MJ1s&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;detructive-battery-testing&quot;&gt;Detructive Battery Testing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week I plan to start destroying some cells.  I’ll over charge them, drain them too quickly, heat them too much, whatever it takes to make them explode, melt down, of fail in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would I be so wasteful and destructive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, these cells are pretty safe.  The chance of a single cell failing catastrophically under normal use is quite low.  In pack of ~5,000 cells, the chance is 5,000 more likely.  For the sake of safety I need to assume that cells will fail during flight.  The battery packs I build need to accommodate failures without damaging their function and more importantly, preventing a chain reaction.  So I need a solid understanding of how these cells fail and what options I have to control the failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;faraday-first&quot;&gt;Faraday First&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I finished modeling and printing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howfliesthealbatross.com/&quot;&gt;Phil’s (How Flies the Albatross)&lt;/a&gt; Faraday First plane. With this design Phil was considering high speed passenger transportation.  It’s got a blended wing shape, but more interesting are the control surfaces.  They are totally unconventional.  On the outer edge of the wings are what look like winglets, but they are rudder-like control surfaces.  They rotate about their vertical axis inducing roll.  There are no ailerons!  The ventral fin on the bottom also rotates, yielding yaw.  And come to think of it, I’m not sure what his plan is for pitch control.  Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s really cool!  But this blog is about a different type of 3D printed airplane.  It’s called the Coulomb Keeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eflight/img/2018-08-14/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flying&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustainableaviation.org/sas2018/&quot;&gt;Sustainable Aviation Symposium&lt;/a&gt;, I introduced myself to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howfliesthealbatross.com/&quot;&gt;Phil from How Flies The Albatross&lt;/a&gt;.  He had given a fascinating talk about his ideas for electric flight and briefly presented two concept planes.  The Coulomb Keeper is the smaller, more general aviation model. The larger, jet like, model is called the Faraday First and perhaps I’ll blog about that one later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I asked Phil if he’d be willing to share he aircraft designs with me so that I could print them and see how they fly.  He agreed!  In fact he asked if I could print him a smaller “draft” model and take pictures for his next presentation.  What he sent me were Blender files.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blender.org/&quot;&gt;Blender is a 3D modeling tool&lt;/a&gt; that is used for amination, games, and a variety of things, but I had never used it before.  Fortunately it’s open source, and free!  Unfortunately, a yak must be shaved to get from Blender .BLEND files to 3D printable .GCODE files.  Allow me to describe the yak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;blend---obj&quot;&gt;.BLEND -&amp;gt; .OBJ&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tool of choice for 3D modeling is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview&quot;&gt;Fusion 360&lt;/a&gt;, which is aimed more at engineering modeling.  I downloaded Blender, installed it, opened the .BLEND files, and exported them to .OBJ files.  Now, you’ll see below that I’ll eventually need .STL files and Blender can export these.  But the model needs modification before we can print it.  Why?  Mostly because it’s too big.  My printer (&lt;a href=&quot;https://craftunique.com/category/craftbot-2&quot;&gt;a Craftunique CraftBot 2&lt;/a&gt;) has a print volume of about 8 inches cubed.  Whereas the printed result has a wingspan of over 2.5 feet.  So I need to work with the model in Fusion 360.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;obj---t-splines&quot;&gt;.OBJ -&amp;gt; T-Splines&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coulomb Keeper .OBJ file imports easily into Fusion 360 as “Mesh”.  Meshes consist of a lot quadrilaterals or triangles that model the outer skins of an object.  However, they are inconvenient for typical manipulations that we’d like to perform, and they are not solid, which is we want.  Fusion 360 has a feature to “Convert Quad-Mesh to T-spline”.  This breaks up the conglomerate Mesh into all the composing pieces (propeller blades, wings, wheels, etc.) in T-Spline format, about 30 of them.  What’s a T-Spline?  Well, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-spline&quot;&gt;T-Spline is like a complicated Mesh&lt;/a&gt;, and a patented specialty of Fusion 360.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;t-splines---surface-bodies&quot;&gt;T-Splines -&amp;gt; Surface Bodies&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-Splines, although powerful, are not what we want.  We want Solid Bodies.  Fusion 360 can “Convert T-Spline to BRep” which get’s us close.  A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation&quot;&gt;BRep, Bourdary Representation&lt;/a&gt;, or Surface Body, is nice smooth model of the skin of the object, which gets us close to Solids.  But, only a fraction of the T-Splines successfully convert into BReps.  Fusion 360 just can’t deal with the geometry of some of the parts.  With some clever tweaking it’s usually possible to successfully convert to Surface Bodies without compromising too much on the exact shape of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;surface-bodies---solid-bodies&quot;&gt;Surface Bodies -&amp;gt; Solid Bodies&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To convert a Surface Body to a Solid Body, you simply patch up all the holes and they magically convert.  Of course it’s never that easy.  Some surfaces have unpluggable holes for whatever reason.  Fusion 360 just chokes on some geometries.  Progress requires that some parts get re-modeled from scratch.  At the end, we have Solid Bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurray!  Now we can work with the model.  Mostly that means combining all the Solid Bodies and cutting them into pieces that will print in the 3D printer; flat bottom surfaces, no overhangs, &amp;lt;45° horizontal angles, and all dimensions less than 200mm.  See the Solid Body model below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eflight/img/2018-08-14/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;CAD&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;solid-body---stl&quot;&gt;Solid Body -&amp;gt; .STL&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)&quot;&gt;.STL files (Standard Triangle Language)&lt;/a&gt; are the universal format for 3D printable models. Fusion 360 embraces 3D printing and makes it easy to export models as .STL files.  I tend to export each of the Solid Bodies individually.  Soon I will have to learn how use Fusion 360’s STL features to combines parts in one file and better prepare them for printing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;stl---gcode&quot;&gt;.STL -&amp;gt; .GCODE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines often consume &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code&quot;&gt;GCode files&lt;/a&gt; which contain detailed commands telling the machines exactly what to do.  That’s true for 3D printers.  Generating GCode from STL is non-trivial and requires the use of a Slicer.  Slicer software allows you to control many aspects of a print job; layer thickness, speed, infill, supporting structures, etc.  There are many open source, free Slicers out there, but I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simplify3d.com/&quot;&gt;Simplify3D&lt;/a&gt; because it was recommended and I find it simple and effective.  There’a bit of art involved in good Slicing, but these parts were not particularly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;gcode---printed-model&quot;&gt;.GCODE -&amp;gt; Printed Model&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward through roughly 18 hours of printing and a little bit of time trimming, sanding, and gluing the parts together.  We now have a Coulomb Keeper, in the flesh,… or plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

The steel springs and screw I had originally used led to voltage sag because of the relatively high resistance of steel.  A better solution is to use Nickel strips and spot weld them to the battery terminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a picture of new welded battery pack for the skateboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eflight/img/2018-08-06/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New Battery Pack&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;spot-welding&quot;&gt;Spot Welding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spot welder works by releasing a pulse (or two) of high current through two leads.  The leads should be touching the material, let’s assume Nickel, to be welded.  The high current heats up the Nickel beyond it’s melting point and once cooled, the metal surfaces are welded together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most spot welders actually release two pulses of current.  The first is a short pulse that will soften the Nickel and burn any contaminants.  Afterwards the leads make much better contact with the Nickel.  This makes the second, longer pulse more effective.  It’s the second pulse that causes the welding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nickel&quot;&gt;Nickel&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pure Nickel is a great material for spot welding batteries.  1) Nickel is 12 times more conductive than stainless steel.  It can carry the high current loads without significant voltage sag.  2) Nickel is 4 times more resistive (25% the conductivity) of copper.  Now, Copper, Silver, Gold, and Aluminum are all better conductors than Nickel, but when it comes to spot welding, we need one metal to melt.  If we tried spot welding copper strips, the copper leads would end up welded to the copper strips.  Not good!  Nickel has enough resistance to soak up some current and heat to it’s melting point first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of building battery packs, I purchased a big roll of 8mm x 0.15mm Nickel tape.  With these dimensions, one strip can safely carry 5 Amps.  But the pack needs to deliver 20 Amps.  So in many places there are multiple strips of Nickle overlapping and welded together.  The combined strips are sufficient to carry the 20A load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;arduino-spot-welder&quot;&gt;Arduino Spot Welder&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try shopping for a spot welder online.  You’ll find industrial welders, the kind used on cars.  And you’ll find welders made in China with chinese labels.  I was pleased to see that there’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Arduino-Battery-Spot-Welder/&quot;&gt;DYI welder built using an Ardiuno&lt;/a&gt;.  Not only does tham mean I can download the source code and play with it, but this welder has hand-held leads and a pedal to trigger the pulses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shared a few emails with &lt;a href=&quot;https://malectrics.eu/&quot;&gt;Marc from Malectrics&lt;/a&gt; and I gotta say, he’s a good guy.  Very helpful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hooked up the Arduino welder to my backup EarthX battery for the OneX, and it worked awesome!  Love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eflight/img/2018-08-06/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sopt Welder&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-not-solder&quot;&gt;Why Not Solder?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be tempting to just solder copper wire between the batteries.  If you’re like me, you already have a soldering iron and plenty of copper wire.  Whereas, spot welders are not so common and are rather pricey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Lithium batteries, heat is the enemy.  It’s always fun to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Li-ion+Thermal+runaway&quot;&gt;Youtube videos of thermal runaway of Li-ion cells&lt;/a&gt;.  Cells reaching temperatures higher than 265°F are susceptible to thermal runaway.  Solder melts at 370°F and soldering irons often reach 600°F or more.  Li-ion batteries do indeed absorb the heat of the solder and the soldering iron and the internal chemicals almost certainly reach 265°.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, brand name 18650 batteries are well made and will not likely explode when you solder them.  But there’s a risk.  And certainly, the heat will damage the cells.  They’ll have less capacity and a shorter life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot welding get’s hot too.  But the heated area is so small and the duration is so short, the head barely penetrates into the cell.  Here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byvr-dwwao4&quot;&gt;video comparing soldering and spot welding with a thermal camera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Micah Martin</name></author><category term="Battery" /><summary type="html">In the previous post on the electric skateboard I alluded to a better way to connect batteries.

I need to start small, so I built an electric skateboard.  It has all the same basic components as the plane will: motor, controller, and battery. To get familiar with that trio, this is an ideal project.  Below is shot of the finished “esk8”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eflight/img/2018-07-18/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Finished Board Top&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LA gang of 8th Light introduced me to esk8s with their Boosted Boards.  I loved them!  My son Luka and I had talked about building one for a couple years.  This was the time to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While watching YouTube videos on the topic, I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D90heZ8z4s&quot;&gt;this video by a guy named Micah Toll&lt;/a&gt;.  (Great name!)  Not only did Micah do a great job on the video, he has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.electricskateboardparts.com/&quot;&gt;a site where he sells electric skateboard kits&lt;/a&gt;. I bought one.  However, I did not buy the battery because I wanted the experience of building the battery pack myself.  And it turns out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/DIY-Lithium-Batteries-Build-Battery/dp/0989906701/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1531974163&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=Micah+Toll&quot;&gt;Micah wrote a book on how to do that&lt;/a&gt;.  I bought the book too and read it one morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying lithium batteries is tricky.  They’re expensive, they’re in high demand and there’s a good deal of fraud out there.  This project only required a handful so I went to my trusted source, Amazon, and purchased 20 Samsung 25R 18650 cells.  These cells have a medium capacity of 2500 mAh and a really nice discharge rate of 20A.  With a 10s2p (10 cells in series, 2 in parallel) the pack will yield 36 nominal volts at 40 amps max.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The the video shows off those nifty &lt;a href=&quot;https://vruzend.com/&quot;&gt;Vrusend battery pack builders&lt;/a&gt;.  Unfortunately they were sold out.  No big deal, I can design something similar in CAD and 3D print them into existance.  The picture below shows the results.  While they were printing I ran to Ace to buy the springs, bolts, and, nuts you see there.  The metal strips are made from left over aluminum sheet from the OneX.  The battery pack came together nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eflight/img/2018-07-18/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;First Battery Holders&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;things-go-wrong&quot;&gt;Things Go Wrong&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithium batteries can be easily damaged if they’re overcharged or drained too much.  Good battery chargers will charge the cells to the perfect voltage, but how do you make sure not to drain them too much?  Even worse, this battery pack has 20 cells of which some may charge or discharge faster than others.  To manage this complexity most battery packs include a circuit board called a BMS, Battery Management System.  It will disconnect cells before they under/over charge and make sure all the cells have a balanced charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BMS I got was about $20 off Amazon.  That’s cheap as far as BMS’s go.  You get what you pay for.  When I connected it, it appeared not to work.  So I ordered another.  It did work.  I charged the pack and all the cells showed a nice high voltage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assembling the rest of the skateboard kit was uneventful.  So with the battery charged I plugged it into the dual motor controllers and they came to life with a beep and solid red LED.  On the handheld remote I pushed on the throttle and the wheels spun!  Awesome!  It was time to ride.  With some zip-ties I strapped everything to the board, put it on the ground, stepped right on and throttled up.  The board moved, but only a bit, and then did nothing.  I unplugged the battery, replugged it, tried again, and the same thing happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a major problem that I attributed to bad controllers.  I emailed Micah.  He had me run some tests and concluded that the BMS was cutting off the battery due to low voltage.  But how could that be?  The lithium cells were brand new and I measured really high voltage coming out of the pack.  Well, Micah pointed out to me that the springs and bolts in my pack were the culprit, causing “voltage sag”.  They are made of steel, and steel has a relatively poor conductivity.  With me on the board it has to pull a significant amount of current to spin the wheels.  Ohms Laws, V=IR.  The voltage drop is proportional to the current and with the high resistance of steel, the voltage drops enough to make the BMS think the batteries have been drained too much.  It cuts out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rebuild&quot;&gt;Rebuild&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time I rebuild the battery pack using more industrial techniques of which I’ll discuss in a later blog.  It’s cool.  And I added 10 more lithium cells to the pack because I had the space and more range is always nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BMS’s caused more problems but I can’t really explain it.  They are like black boxes, giving no indication of what they’re doing, or not doing.  And I may have fried one while I was disassembling the first battery pack.  It made a big spark when it shorted against a sharp piece of solder poking through the positive battery terminal insulation.  Eventually I got the original BMS working.  Don’t know how exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below you can see all the guts of the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/eflight/img/2018-07-18/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Internals&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finished-board&quot;&gt;Finished Board&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step was to create a protective cover for all the electronics.  I whipped up a simple design in Fusion 360 and printed it over 2 days.  There are 5 attach points to mount the cover to the board, and there are 3 holes for the charging plug, on/off button, and battery status screen.  I installed it today and it fit perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was nothing left to do except ride it!  I cruised around the neighborhood for maybe a mile or more, averaging 10 mph perhaps.  Gee, what fun it was!  The board performed like a champ and had 85% battery charge remaining.  However, it did get hot.  The rear trucks, attached to the motorized wheel, must have been almost 200°F.  Of course, if you carried me for a mile at 10mph on a 110°F day in Pheonix, you’d be hot too.&lt;/p&gt;

Much has been done since I completed the OneX in January.  But I only recently decided to create this blog. Details about my activities will come in later blog entries, but what’s on my mind now is batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First some background.  Now that I’ve built a conventional plane, my next focus is on electric propulsion.  And the major project here is to electrify a conventional airplane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I had hoped to sell the OneX or keep it as a toy, I’ve decided that it’s a decent candidate for electrification.  And with that decision made, a million questions arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where do I get an electric motor?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How much power? Torque? RPM?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What kind of propeller will be needed?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do I get the controller for the motor?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do I make a battery?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a few months of research but I’ve answered most of these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;motor&quot;&gt;Motor&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://emrax.com/products/emrax-268/&quot;&gt;Emrax 268&lt;/a&gt; is on order.  Emrax makes the most powerful motors for their weight, making them very popular for aircraft.  So popular that it’ll take them 14 weeks to fulfill my order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;controller&quot;&gt;Controller&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emrax had a short list of recommended controllers for their motor.  Choosing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.unitek-industrie-elektronik.de/bamocar-d3&quot;&gt;Unitek Bamorcar&lt;/a&gt; was easy.  I look forward to playing with it in a few weeks when it arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;propeller&quot;&gt;Propeller&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lonnie Prince of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.princeaircraft.com/&quot;&gt;Prince Aircraft Company&lt;/a&gt; has been very helpful.  Given the power of the motor and anticipated cruise speed, he can build the ideal propeller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;battery&quot;&gt;Battery&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current story card.  The requirements are determined by the motor/controller: &lt;strong&gt;700V, 400A max.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla’s first car, the Roadster, used laptop batteries.  Thousands of 18650 lithium batteries.  Since then, that’s what everyone’s been doing.  As shall I.  How many cells do I need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single 18650 cell has a nominal voltage of about ~3.6V.  Cell in series add their voltage. 700 / 3.6 = &lt;strong&gt;~195 cells in series&lt;/strong&gt; at least!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cells in parallel add their current.  But the discharge current of cells varies with the chemestry of the cell.  I want the most energy for the least amount of weight.  One of the highest capacity cells is the Samsung 35E.  It has a max continuous discharge rate of &lt;strong&gt;8A&lt;/strong&gt;, capacity of &lt;strong&gt;3500 mAh&lt;/strong&gt;, and a weight of &lt;strong&gt;50g&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;400 / 8 = 50 cells minimum to achieve 400A.  How many cells are needed to satisfy both Amps and Volts?  50 * 195 = 9750 cells. Yike!  That many cells would weight 488kg, 1073lbs.  Way too much!  Let’s work this from the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weight allocation for batteries is about 250lbs, ~114kg.  That’s 2280 cells.  400V should yield plenty of power.  That’s 111 cells in series, allowing 20 parallel groups yielding 160 amps.  That’d be 65kW which is about 80HP, the same as the motor in the plane now.  I want more.  Maybe I need to reconsider the weight allocation.  Either way, I need to put all this in a spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;eye-candy&quot;&gt;Eye Candy&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image is just eye candy.  I’ll talk about the CAD design later.&lt;/p&gt;
