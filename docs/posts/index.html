        I need to tell you all about 3D printing flying R/C planes, and I will. It’s really cool! But this blog is about a different type of 3D printed airplane. It’s called the Coulomb Keeper. While at the Sustainable Aviation Symposium, I introduced myself to Phil from How Flies The...

        In the previous post on the electric skateboard I alluded to a better way to connect batteries. The steel springs and screw I had originally used led to voltage sag because of the relatively high resistance of steel. A better solution is to use Nickel strips and spot weld them...

        An electric plane is a large project. I need to start small, so I built an electric skateboard. It has all the same basic components as the plane will: motor, controller, and battery. To get familiar with that trio, this is an ideal project. Below is shot of the finished...

        This is the starting point of this blog, but it’s more of a midpoint in my efforts. Much has been done since I completed the OneX in January. But I only recently decided to create this blog. Details about my activities will come in later blog entries, but what’s on...
